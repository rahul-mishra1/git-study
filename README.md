Getting Started
Install Rails at the command prompt if you haven't yet:

 $ gem install rails
At the command prompt, create a new Rails application:

 $ rails new myapp
where "myapp" is the application name.

Change directory to myapp and start the web server:

 $ cd myapp
 $ bin/rails server
Run with --help or -h for options.

Go to http://localhost:3000 and you'll see: "Yay! Youâ€™re on Rails!"
